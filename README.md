# Professional Portfolio | PraveenKumar A

A high-performance, minimalist professional portfolio built with React and Vite. This project showcases a blend of modern UI/UX design, architectural optimizations, and interactive visualizations.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights

- **Aesthetic Overhaul**: Implemented a "Warm Minimalist" design system using a curated Stone, Cream, and Tan palette.
- **Performance Optimization**: Integrated **React.lazy** and **Suspense** for route-based code splitting, ensuring lightning-fast initial load times.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Leveraged **Framer Motion** for:
  - Infinite vertical skills scroll.
  - Interactive atomic orbits representing core technologies.
  - Smooth entrance and exit page transitions.
- **Responsive Navigation**: Standardized internal linking with smoothness using **react-router-hash-link**.
- **Clean Architecture**: Refactored the global state and routing logic for maximum maintainability and modularity.
